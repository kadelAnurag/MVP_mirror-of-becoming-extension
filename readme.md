# Mirror of Becoming â€” MVP

**Mirror of Becoming â€” MVP** is a lightweight Chrome extension that detects rapid tab switching or window changes and presents a minimal overlay with an archetype-based prompt. Its purpose is to introduce a short reflective pause during browsing, helping you notice and question unconscious switching habits without blocking your activity.

This MVP demonstrates the concept described in my research paper on attention, friction, and reflective interface design.
